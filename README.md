# Overview

This repo contains code for the "Transfer Learning" workshop.

The `scripts` directory contains helpers for the workshop. Some of these come from the main TensorFlow repository, and are included here so you can use them without also downloading the main TensorFlow repo (they are not part of the TensorFlow `pip` installation).
